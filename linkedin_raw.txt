--- SUMMARY ---
I am Juan Pablo Valdez, a Software Developer with a product mindset. I deeply engage in understanding the business, talking to customers, and making technical decisions that truly move metrics; I consider myself highly analytical. I believe the best code is the one that solves real user problems.

I work with e-commerce and fintech startups, where I learned that performance, security, and UX are not optional—they are what separate a product that converts from one that doesn't. In a Swedish e-commerce company with 3,000+ monthly clients, I optimized checkout flows, Core Web Vitals, and conversion rates using real data from Analytics and Heatmaps.

My main stack is React, Next.js, React Native, Node.js, and TypeScript, but what differentiates me is how I use it: with a focus on end-to-end ownership, from discovery to production. I complement this with Nest.js, Prisma, Docker, AWS, and CI/CD pipelines that maintain quality.

Long-term, I would love to build the product of my dreams as a founder. For now, I am looking for remote Software roles in startups where I can grow, contribute my founder-mindset, and surround myself with smart people to learn from. Beyond code, I am passionate about economics, the startup ecosystem, blockchain, golf, and understanding how technology transforms industries.
