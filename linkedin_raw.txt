--- SUMMARY ---
Software Developer who treats code as a business tool, not just to write syntax.

What I bring beyond code: I talk to customers, read the data, and make technical decisions that move metrics. In e-commerce and fintech, I learned that performance, security, and UX aren't nice-to-haves, they're what separates products that convert from ones that don't.

Looking for: Remote roles at startups where I can own features end-to-end and learn from smart people. I'm building my own product PartySpot in my free time.

My stack: React, Next.js, React Native, Node.js, TypeScript, Nest.js, Prisma, Docker, AWS, CI/CD.
Outside work: business, economics, startups, blockchain, golf.

Core: React, Next.js, React Native, Node.js, TypeScript, Nest.js
Tools & DevOps: Docker, AWS, CI/CD, Prisma, React Query, PostgreSQL, Terraform
Languages: English (Full Professional), Spanish (Native/Bilingual)
